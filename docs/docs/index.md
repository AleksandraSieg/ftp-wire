A **multi-client FTP system** built in Java, supporting **file transfers, authentication, and command-based communication** between clients and a central server.

---

## Overview
**FTP-WIRE** was built to be an extensible, effecient and most importantly scalable solution for the file transfering service on a computer machine. it is mainly built of 2 modules: a `Client` and a `Server` modules, these modules should be integratable to any other apps in the future which need to use an ftp service (may be not yet acquired, but this is a long term goal).

Many aspects where taken into consideration while designing such software architecture and functions including but not limited to:

- Effecient CPU utilization in the server module.
- Usage of many Design Patterns which results a generic code and improve scalability in the future, such as adding new commands or changing a
  packet contents.

The current project version had been refactored about 2 times before reaching this stage of the developement.

## Features
- **Authentication** & **Handshaking** system
- Command-based protocol (`LIST`, `RETR`, `STOR`, etc.)
- Modular structure with `Common`, `Server`, and `Client` packages
- **Multi-client support** – handles multiple connections simultaneously.
- **Scalable & High-performance** – uses **Thread Pool architecture** and **Non-blocking I/O (NIO)**.
- **File transfer** – clients can download files from the server.
- **Command execution** – processes various client commands.
- **Logging & Monitoring system** – structured logs via `ClientLogger` / `ServerLogger` or debugging, tracking client activity, and monitoring transfers.
- **Error handling & Disconnection discovery** – Clean detection of remote disconnections and graceful shutdown/termination logic of client disconnections.
- **Extensible design patterns** – leverages reusable patterns for future extensions.
