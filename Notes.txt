CLIENT BUGS:
1) when typing connect without the remote and local specification we get NullPointerException [solved]
2) when connecting to remote then quitting, and then connection again, some thread exception is thrown [solved]
3) when quitting remote, i have to call set_remote again [solved]
4) when quitting with quit command i get this: [WARNING]: Remote server disconnected. :
for this look at the last chat gpt query, he gave a good solution. [solved]

CLIENT OPTIMIZATIONS:
1) set_remote 127.12.12.12 gets "Invalid command", it should say something more specific. [solved]

CLIENT FEATURES:
1) add command to show available commands in offline mode [solved]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SERVER OPTIMIZATIONS:
1) delete the CommandRegistry and integrate the content inside the CommandType enum
2) A client should have a FileManager instead of keeping that functionality in the ClientProfile Class,
it should be a separate class.
3) check this bug:

(Makaty@\..\Spring_Book)> nlist
chapter 10\
(Makaty@\..\Spring_Book)> cwd chapter 10
Invalid command args count or type.
